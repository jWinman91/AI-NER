# AI-Extractor

It extracts information such as names, credit card numbers, customer numbers, addresses, ... from free text and replaces it with a placeholder of your choice.
It functions a bit like a smart (LLM-powered) find-and-replace function.

E.g. it can anonymize names in a text or exchange the recipient/author names of a batch of emails.
